# How to Contribute to the Project  

Currently, the *Docbao Crawler* project is being refactored and documentation is being added to aim not only to be a useful project for the data processing community but also an educational project for programming enthusiasts who want to learn Python.

To achieve this goal, the project greatly appreciates support from the community, focusing on tasks:

**For beginners in programming**
- Write tutorials on how to install and use *Docbao Crawler* to inspire and assist newcomers in programming to access the project.
- Issue any code snippets you find difficult to understand / need additional documentation / code smell for the author to improve.
- Participate in recompiling instructional documents for configuration creation, system operation... to make them easier to understand and access.

**For experienced programmers, we eagerly welcome your participation in tasks such as:**
- Contribute to writing articles explaining how *Docbao Crawler* works and topics that can help newcomers to programming more easily approach building and developing the crawler.
- Participate in configuring to scan new sources, gradually building a shared repository within the community.
- Improve the frontend interface for convenience.
- Transition installation to using Docker to make it easier for beginners to learn programming.
- Improve source code and create Pull Requests to make the project more feature-rich and accessible to programming learners.

**For those who are not programmers but are interested in the project, we greatly appreciate your support in tasks such as:**
- Completing the Code of Conduct for using the *Docbao Crawler* (see CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md for more details).
- Contributing ideas, issues that using *Docbao Crawler* can help the community. For example: combating Fake news, checking copied news...
- Building a community to connect those who need to use data with data source owners (such as newspaper agencies, blog owners, websites...) to gradually legitimize data scanning activities.
- Supporting the project in obtaining licenses (or similar forms) from content source owners so that the project can share scanning configuration files with the community.
